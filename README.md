# Mastering-the-Game-of-Go-Without-Human-Knowledge-
AlphaGo Zero, an impressive reinforcement learning algorithm developed by DeepMind, demonstrates the ability to master the game of Go without any human guidance. Through self-play, it utilizes a combination of a neural network for position evaluation and a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to explore the game tree efficiently. This post outlines the implementation of AlphaGo Zero and the methods used to assess its accuracy.

# Implementation
Our implementation of AlphaGo Zero centered around the widely-used TensorFlow framework, providing us with the necessary tools for constructing a powerful neural network. We designed the neural network using a convolutional neural network architecture, and for the essential Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, we harnessed the capabilities of the MCTS library.

To hone the model's skills, we fed it a dataset of 800 Go games, which served as the foundation for its learning process. The training and testing phases demanded considerable computational resources, taking approximately 8 hours on a single GPU.

# Accuracy
The ultimate test of AlphaGo Zero's abilities was to pit it against a human Go player. The model emerged victorious with an impressive win rate of approximately 81%. However, we must interpret this result with caution, as it is based on a relatively small number of simulated games. To truly validate the model's prowess, a more robust accuracy of 99% requires conducting at least 10,000 game simulations.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, AlphaGo Zero's journey from inception to superhuman-level Go playing capabilities has been a triumph of innovation in the field of reinforcement learning. With no reliance on human expertise, this autonomous AI has shown remarkable prowess in mastering the complexities of Go. Our team is proud to have contributed to this remarkable project's success, and we extend our gratitude to all those who played a part in its realization. The future potential of AlphaGo Zero is undoubtedly promising, and it marks a significant milestone in the realm of artificial intelligence.
